## Project Overview

To The Moon needed a new website and storefront to power their merch drops.

import BreakoutImage from '@components/BreakoutImage.astro'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'

## Technical Challenges

I made extensive custom updates to the chosen Liquid theme to match their vision, including a dynamic star-filled space background. Using pure CSS kept the experience fast and lightweight.
