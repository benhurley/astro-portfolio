## Project Overview

To The Moon! is a lifestyle brand that recently expanded into clothing and needed a storefront to manage their drops.

import BlockQuote from '@components/BlockQuote.astro'
import BreakoutImage from '@components/BreakoutImage.astro'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'

## Technical Challenges

Extensive updates were made to an existing Liquid theme to help bring their vision to life, including a dynamic star-filled space background. Using pure CSS kept the experience fast and lightweight.

## Testimonial

  Ben was an amazing communicator from start to finish. He clearly explained what needed to be done and offered smart suggestions for how we could make our site stronger. We gave him a set of website mocks, and he turned them into a fully realized, polished site incredibly fast. He’s professional, easy to talk to, and genuinely great at what he does. Working with Ben made the whole process smooth and stress-free. He’s become a trusted partner in our digital presence.
