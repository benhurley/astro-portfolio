## Project Overview

The SVPLY CHVN Project is a Web3 music project developed by Daramola as a way to release his music.

According to Daramola, "Last year, I celebrated 50.7 million streams across all platforms. While these numbers were impressive, I don't believe they achieved the deserved financial value."

## Technical Challenges

A previous version of this site featured a record spinning inside one of Daramolaâ€™s album covers. Using CSS, I recreated it in higher quality and with far better performance. On hover, the cover glides aside to reveal the rotating vinyl beneath, creating a sleek, tactile interaction that brings the album to life.

  AccessGuard has transformed how we approach web security. We no longer have to choose between robust security and
  accessibility - we get both in one solution, and our compliance scores have never been better.
