## Project Overview

The IPSDI Exposure Tracker empowers you to take control of your exposure history with a comprehensive, secure record that stays with you. 

Leadership at IPSDI tasked me with designing and building the Exposure Tracker frontends for web, iOS, and Android.

## Technical Challenges

The app needed to be <b>easy to learn</b> and <b>simple to use</b>. This meant auto-saving, minimizing taps/clicks, and providing clear UI feedback would be paramount.

We built with Ionic React to deploy the same app across web, iOS, and Android from a single codebase. While this saved significant development time, it required solving platform-specific challenges around navigation, native features, and UI consistency.

The app also integrates live analytics data from IPSDI Analytics via API. I designed a simple interface that automatically suggests incidents using existing exposure data without requiring additional user input (see example below).
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
  <a href="#img1" class="cursor-zoom-in">
    <Image
      src="/projects/exposure-tracker/project-image-1.png"
      alt="To The Moon homepage featuring animated starfield background"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
    />
  </a>
  <a href="#img2" class="cursor-zoom-in">
    <Image
      src="/projects/exposure-tracker/project-image-2.png"
      alt="Product collection page showcasing streetwear merchandise"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
    />
  </a>
  <a href="#img3" class="cursor-zoom-in">
    <Image
      src="/projects/exposure-tracker/project-image-3.png"
      alt="Individual product page with custom design elements"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
    />
  </a>
  <a href="#img4" class="cursor-zoom-in">
    <Image
      src="/projects/exposure-tracker/project-image-4.png"
      alt="Mobile responsive view of the To The Moon storefront"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
    />
  </a>
</div>

The new apps launched at the end of 2025, and are helping figherfighters and first responders accurately self-document their exposures.
