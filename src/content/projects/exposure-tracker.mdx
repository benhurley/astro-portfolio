## Project Overview

The IPSDI Exposure Tracker empowers firefighters and first responders to take control of their exposure history with a comprehensive, secure record that stays with them over the course of their career.

Leadership at IPSDI tasked me with designing and building the Exposure Tracker frontends for **iOS, Android, and web**.

## Technical Challenges

The app needed to be **easy to learn** and **simple to use**. That meant auto-saving by default, minimizing taps and clicks, and providing clear, immediate UI feedback at every step.

We built the product using **Ionic React**, allowing us to deploy the same application across iOS, Android, and web from a single codebase. While this significantly reduced development time, it required solving platform-specific challenges around navigation paradigms, native feature access, and UI consistency.

The app also integrates live analytics data from **IPSDI Analytics** via API. I designed an interface that automatically suggests incidents using existing exposure data, reducing user input and speeding up documentation (examples below).

The new apps launched at the end of **2025** and are helping firefighters and first responders accurately self-document their exposures.

## Press & Podcasts

In **January 2026**, Chief John Oates joined the *Better Every Shift Podcast* to explain why personal exposure tracking matters — not just for immediate reporting, but as a **career-long personal record** that can support long-term health, legal, and insurance needs.

The episode highlights how the *IPSDI Exposure Tracker* enables firefighters to document fireground exposures, traumatic calls, hazmat incidents, and unique situations independently of departmental systems — ensuring critical information isn’t lost over time.
