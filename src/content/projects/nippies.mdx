## Project Overview

Originally launched as an NFT art project, The Nippies needed a web directory that showcased each collector's X account and immersed visitors in their playful universe. Every asset was hand-drawn by artist <a href="https://scubasteveart.com/"     target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Scuba Steve</a>, giving the site a unique, handcrafted character.

## Technical Challenges

The most complex challenge was implementing sorting, pagination, and a "shuffle" feature within the main gridâ€”while supporting two distinct artwork collections. The solution had to balance functionality with performance and fluid UI transitions.
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
  <Image
    src="/projects/nippies/project-image-1.png"
    alt="To The Moon homepage featuring animated starfield background"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
    class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
  />
  <Image
    src="/projects/nippies/project-image-2.png"
    alt="Product collection page showcasing streetwear merchandise"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
    class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
  />
  <Image

    alt="Individual product page with custom design elements"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
    class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
  />
  <Image
    src="/projects/nippies/project-image-4.png"
    alt="Mobile responsive view of the To The Moon storefront"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
    class="h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover border-1"
  />
</div>

The directory launched to widespread acclaim within the Solana ecosystem and served the community for several years.

## Testimonial

<BlockQuote author="Scuba Steve, Founder of The Nippies">
Working with Ben was a serious treat! 
He translated our word salad of an idea into executable steps that made sense to a code-illiterate person. He had a speedy response time and professional attitude keeping up with our frequent needs to update copy and images. 10/10 would hire again!
